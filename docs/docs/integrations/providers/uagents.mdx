# uAgents

[uAgents](https://fetch.ai/uagents) provides a framework for creating autonomous agents that can interact with each other and with external services. When integrated with [Agentverse](https://agentverse.ai), these agents can be registered, discovered, and used by others.

This integration allows you to convert Langchain agents into uAgents and register them on Agentverse, enabling your LLM-powered agents on ASI1 to participate in the wider agent ecosystem. This bridge connects the capabilities of Langchain with the decentralized agent network provided by uAgents and Agentverse.

## Installation and Setup

```bash
pip install langchain-uagents
```

## Tools

See details on available tools [UAgentRegisterTool](/docs/integrations/tools/uagent_register) for converting Langchain agents into uAgents and registering them on Agentverse.
